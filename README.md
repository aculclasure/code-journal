# code-journal
A place to keep all my code that doesn't fit neatly into a specific project.

##  :beginner: About
This repo contains code I've worked on that doesn't fit neatly into a specific project but still has reference value (to me anyways). If any of the code in this repo grows to the point where it makes sense to be moved to it's own repo in the future, then I will do that. My main intentions for this repo are to:

- have a portfolio where I can track my personal growth over time across multiple programming languages
- be able to share my solutions with others who might be working on the same problems I've worked on

Currently, this repo is organized by programming language:

- [go](./go)
  - [exercism](./go/exercism): My work on the [Go track] at [exercism.io], where mentors 
  provide feedback on programming challenges.
